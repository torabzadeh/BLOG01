  abstract={Canopy structure plays an essential role in biophysical activities in forest environments. However, quantitative descriptions of a 3-D canopy structure are extremely difficult because of the complexity and heterogeneity of forest systems. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides an opportunity to automatically measure a 3-D canopy structure in large areas. Compared with other point cloud technologies such as the image-based Structure from Motion, the power of ALS lies in its ability to penetrate canopies and depict subordinate trees. However, such capabilities have been poorly explored so far. In this paper, the potential of ALS-based approaches in depicting a 3-D canopy structure is explored in detail through an international benchmarking of five recently developed ALS-based individual tree detection (ITD) methods. For the first time, the results of the ITD methods are evaluated for each of four crown classes, i.e., dominant, codominant, intermediate, and suppressed trees, which provides insight toward understanding the current status of depicting a 3-D canopy structure using ITD methods, particularly with respect to their performances, potential, and challenges. This benchmarking study revealed that the canopy structure plays a considerable role in the detection accuracy of ITD methods, and its influence is even greater than that of the tree species as well as the species composition in a stand. The study also reveals the importance of utilizing the point cloud data for the detection of intermediate and suppressed trees. Different from what has been reported in previous studies, point density was found to be a highly influential factor in the performance of the methods that use point cloud data. Greater efforts should be invested in the point-based or hybrid ITD approaches to model the 3-D canopy structure and to further explore the potential of high-density and multiwavelengths ALS data.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle and it is largely unknown how this role might be altered by transients imposed by global change and deforestation. Remote sensing can provide information on ecosystem state and functioning and, among others, two remote sensing techniques, airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS), have been used to characterize forest ecosystems, both independently and combined in fusion approaches. However, the fusion of these datasetsshould make the best use of the complementarity of both sensors and provide better and more robust vegetation products in forested ecosystems. Similar to other data fusion approaches, satisfying results depend on choosing appropriate fusion levels and methods. In this review paper, we summarize and classify relevant studies that focused on forest characterization using combined ALS and IS data, limited to the last decade. We classified the approaches by fusion level (data or product level) and by choice of methods (physical or empirical methods). Five different categories of products (landcover maps, aboveground biomass, biophysical parameters, gross/net primary productivity and biochemical parameters), have been found as the main aspects of forest ecosystems studied so far. A qualitative accuracy analysis of the products exposed that currently landcover maps are profiting the most from ALS and IS data fusion, while there is room for improvements in respect to the other products, such as biophysical parameters. Only few studies using physical approaches were found, but we expect the use of such approaches will increase with the growing availability of physically based radiative transfer models that can simulate both, ALS and IS data.}

abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial distribution of tree species is important for efficiently managing and monitoring forested ecosystems, especially in mixed forests of the temperate zone. In this study, we fused imaging spectroscopy (IS) data with leaf-on and off small-footprint airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, for tree species identification in a dense temperate forest in Switzerland. In addition to the spectral reflectance of the sunlit part of the tree crowns, structural features computed based on the height, intensity and point distribution of ALS data in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions are used as features. Features were extracted using a pixel-based (1 m × 1 m) and an individual tree crown approach. In addition, applying a floating forward feature selection approach revealed that the ALS-derived features provided relevant structural information for species identification, while IS-derived features added complementary biochemical information. Comparing the accuracies of three different combinations of ALS and IS data, shows the highest classification accuracy (kappa = 90.3%) was obtained by fusing a selected set of features at individual tree crowns (ITC), while the best kappa accuracies resulting from IS or ALS data alone were 74.7% and 75.1%, respectively. Inclusion of the ITC information improved the classification results for all datasets, however, this improvement is significantly higher for ALS derived datasets (+31%). Our results show that accurate ITC information drastically improves classification accuracy of tree species in dense forests and that multi-seasonal ALS structural attributes play a major part in species discrimination.}

ABSTRACT = {Canopy layers form essential structural components, affecting stand productivity and wildlife habitats. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides horizontal and vertical information on canopy structure simultaneously. Existing approaches to assess canopy layering often require prior information about stand characteristics or rely on pre-defined height thresholds. We developed a multi-scale method using ALS data with point densities >10 pts/m2 to determine the number and vertical extent of canopy layers (canopylayer, canopylength), seasonal variations in the topmost canopy layer (canopytype), as well as small-scale heterogeneities in the canopy (canopyheterogeneity). We first tested and developed the method on a small forest patch (800 ha) and afterwards tested transferability and robustness of the method on a larger patch (180,000 ha). We validated the approach using an extensive set of ground data, achieving overall accuracies >77% for canopytype and canopyheterogeneity, and >62% for canopylayer and canopylength. We conclude that our method provides a robust characterization of canopy layering supporting automated canopy structure monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate and reliable assessment of above-ground biomass (AGB) is important for the sustainable forest management, especially in Zagros forests, in which a frangible forest ecosystem is being threatened by anthropogenic factors as well as climate change effects. This study presents a new method for AGB estimation and demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data as an alternative to other costly remotely sensed data, such as hyperspectral and LiDAR data in unapproachable regions. Sentinel-2 performance was evaluated for a forest in Kurdistan province, west of Iran, using in-situ measured AGB as a dependent variable and spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices as independent variables in the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm. The influence of the input variables number on AGB prediction was also investigated. The model using all spectral bands plus all derived spectral vegetation indices provided better AGB estimates (R2 = 0.87 and RMSE = 10.75 t ha−1). Including the optimal subset of key variables did not improve model variance but slightly reduced the error. This result is explained by the technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, which includes fine spatial resolution (10, 20 m) and strategically-positioned bands (red-edge), conducted in different topographical conditions with an advanced machine learning algorithm. However, assessing its transferability to other forest types with varying conditions would enable future performance and interpretability assessments of Sentinel-2.},

A single season of excavations directed by Esmail Hemati Azandaryani was undertaken in 2017 and led to the discovery of a temple dating to the Median period. This temple, with its stepped lozenge plan, is very similar to, but larger than the Central Temple at Tepe Nush-i Jan near Malayer.},
