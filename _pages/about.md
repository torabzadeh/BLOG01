I am an assistant professor of remote sensing, working in Geomatics lab, [Bu-Ali Sina University](https://www.basu.ac.ir/), Iran. 

I received my Ph.D. in remote sensing from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), my M.Sc. in photogrammetry from [K.N.Toosi university](https://kntu.ac.ir/index.aspx?lang=2&sub=39) in Tehran and my B.S. in surveying engineering from [University of Isfahan](https://www.ui.ac.ir/en).

My academic work focuses on using lidar and imaging spectrometry for vegetation characterization, and the link between remote sensing data and changes in environment. My research relies on statistical and computational methods.
